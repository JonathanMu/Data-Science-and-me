# Data-Science-and-me

Science is something that i have always been inteerested in and have followed that passion through my early education all the way into college.  In all of this data has always been the bedfellow.  Many processes that explain the natural world conform to theroetical principles that were formulated based upon data, be that observation or empirical data.  Career wise data and science in general has not joined me on that path.  Although i did partake outside work hours with light reading on interesting subject matter and even taken a few online courses on what is clearly data science.  Its time to link everything back up again and leverage off the superdatascience's 99 day study plan and link all the concepts together finally.

This will be my journey even if it takes longer than 99 days.


Week 1 :

luckily this weeks course is one that i have already done in the past Careers in Data Science A-z on udemy.  Being a refresher i was able to speed through that course at double speed.  The handouts provided for each module are very clear and concise and beautifully laid out to up your inspiration levels.
For background reading i decided upon confident data skills by Kirill Eremenko as he is the founder of superdatascience and i have been actively following his podcasts every day on the commute to and from work.  I will have four weeks to complete this book from front to back cover or as much as that is possible on a kindle.

Last but not least is a github profile so this one has been resurected from the past to be my diary on this journey as well as housing any projects that i partakle in along the way.
